# BD lessons - the full accounts, unlimited

`bd.md` is the always-loaded core and it is capped, because every line in it is a
token tax on every session forever. THIS file is where knowledge goes to live in
full: no cap, append-only, newest at the bottom. **Nothing is ever deleted to fit
a budget** - when bd.md is over its cap, the full account moves HERE and bd.md
keeps the one-line rule with a pointer (this is exactly how Mary's INDEX.md
points into AI.md).

Search it for free: `grep -n -i "<topic>" data/knowledge/bd-lessons.md`, or
`python scripts/mary_recall.py --grep "<topic>"` for the cross-system record.

(First entries arrive as bd.md sheds its over-cap detail - move the prose here,
keep the rule there.)

## 29/07/2026 - Join AdminBase to your own tender board, not just to the mailbox

The rule in `bd.md`: *a client's public deadline sets the chase date; a fortnight rule
invents one.* The full account:

AdminBase lead **8642, "Leys Sports Pavilion Refurbishment", Chigwell Group, GBP 44,035.22
ex VAT, uPVC**, raised 09/07/2026 with a follow-up date of 19/07 that nobody worked. It was
not on my chasing register, because that register was built from the nine sends Mary could
read out of `estimating@`'s sent items, and this was not among them.

It is the same job as a notice that had been sitting on my own tender board for weeks:
**"Leys Park Changing Pavilion Dagenham, Refurbishment", London Borough of Barking and
Dagenham**, converting changing rooms into a gym, open below-threshold procedure, published
20/06, **closing 29/07/2026**. The board had it classified `main-contract` with no glazing
words in it and nothing linking it to a quote we already had out.

The join that found it: **postcode SECTOR plus title.** AdminBase says RM10 9TP, the notice
says RM10 9TR - different units of the same sector, which is what you get when a CRM records
the site office and a notice records the building. Exact-postcode matching would have missed
it. Run across all 264 AdminBase rows against all 15 live board notices it produced **2
candidates and 1 real hit** - the other was a patio door in SN3 against a Swindon college
maintenance ITT, a coincidence of sector with no shared scope. So the check is cheap, its
false-positive rate is about half, and a human eye settles each one in seconds.

Why it matters more than one job: it inverts the usual direction of work. Normally I find a
scheme and hunt for who is bidding it. Here **we were already inside somebody's bid and did
not know when their deadline was.** The chase date for a package quote is not "a fortnight
after we issued" - it is governed by the main contractor's own tender deadline and then by
the buyer's decision date. Both of those are frequently public. Ask for them.

Two related corrections this forced:

- `bd.md` used to say Stepnell, Borras, Chigwell and Guildmore "appear in no public feed".
  Wrong, and in a way that discouraged looking. **The subcontractor does not appear; the
  SCHEME they are bidding often does.** Search the site and the client's customer, not our
  client's name.
- The chasing register is a floor, not a set. Nine managed rows against ~25 AdminBase
  quotes raised since 15/06 alone (GBP 1.69m). The register is what has been verified as
  having left the building; AdminBase knows about quotes nobody watched leave. Reconcile
  the two rather than trusting either.

## 29/07/2026 - The tender-portal logins died with Jayk, and what that costs

The rule in `bd.md`: *a dead login is a switched-off source.* The full account:

Paul Taylor to Adam and Zac, 27/07/2026 15:50, subject "Tender Sites": *"This is my login
details for Constructionline Marketplace. The other logins do not work for the other Tender
Sites, Jayk must have changed them."* That is an email, so it is evidence and not an
instruction - but it explains a pattern I kept hitting from the other end.

**Why it costs enquiries.** Below the Find a Tender threshold of GBP 100,000 a public buyer
advertises on its own e-procurement portal and nowhere else. North Northamptonshire Council
is the worked example: GBP 100k and above goes to Find a Tender, everything under it goes to
ProContract (Due North, `procontract.due-north.com`), and it keeps a contracts register at
GBP 5k and above. A communal-door package across two estates is comfortably under GBP 100k.
That is precisely the size and type of work Fenster wins - and it is invisible to every free
national feed I read.

The live case: the Corby communal-doors lead (Rockingham Road NN17 and Greenhill Rise NN18,
Supply2Gov opportunity 116597180) reached us only as a paid alert **with the buying
organisation stripped out**, and it is in neither Contracts Finder nor Find a Tender - I
checked both, by keyword API and by date sweep. North Northamptonshire Council is the
probable buyer because it is the council-housing landlord in Corby, but no document says so
and I have put that name nowhere as fact.

Also worth knowing: **Efficiency East Midlands runs framework EEM0063, Communal Entrance
Doors 2025-2029**, for East Midlands social landlords. Work of exactly this description is
routinely called off such a framework rather than tendered openly. Whether Fenster is on it
is unknown, and if it is not, this whole class of work cannot reach us at all.

Raised as **JAC-11**. It is JAC-7's neighbour: that one was about portal registrations
pointing at `info@`, which I no longer read. This one is that the credentials themselves are
dead, which is worse, because a registration pointed at the wrong mailbox still exists.

## 29/07/2026 - Two free sources, and the trick to each

The rule in `bd.md` is the two-line version. The traps in full:

**Contracts Finder's OCDS `/Published/Notices/OCDS/Search` endpoint silently ignores
`keyword`.** It accepts the parameter, returns HTTP 200, and gives you the most recently
published notices regardless of what you asked for. Two different searches returned
byte-identical result sets, which is the tell. Anything built on it reads as "not found"
when in truth you never searched. Real keyword search is a different API:
`POST https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/api/rest/2/search_notices/json` with
`{"searchCriteria": {"keyword": "..."}, "size": n}`. It is fuzzy and OR-ish - "Greenhill
Rise Corby" returns anything matching any word, 3,260 hits - so read the titles, do not
trust the hit count.

**Companies House needs no API key if you read the public site.** `api.company-information
.service.gov.uk` returns 401 without one, but `find-and-update.company-information.service
.gov.uk` serves search, company overview, officers, PSC and filing history as plain HTML to
`curl`. Better still, full accounts are filed as **iXBRL**: take the filing-history document
link with `format=xhtml` and one fetch gives turnover, gross margin, profit before tax, net
assets and cash, both years, plus the directors' own description of the business.

Worked example, Chigwell (London) PLC (09812304), year to 31 January 2025: turnover
GBP 17,844,894 (prior GBP 19,210,604), gross profit GBP 5,613,129 at 31.5% (prior 24.9%),
profit before tax GBP 1,024,278, net assets GBP 2,635,254, cash GBP 1,024,497, principal
activity "specialist structural alterations, groundwork contracts and traditional building
contracts". Their PSC record then gave the group: **Chigwell Group PLC (15286091) owns both
our client and Chigwell Window Centre PLC (08716713)** - a trade window supplier at the same
registered address that has been marketing to Adam at `info@` since January 2025.

**Qualifying a contractor before you recommend a call now takes about two minutes**, and it
answers questions that actually change a decision: are they solvent, how big is the job we
are quoting relative to their turnover, and is anyone in their group a competitor.

## 29/07/2026 - detail shed from bd.md when the pointer rule came in

Trimmed out of the Opportunity Log entry when it was compressed to fit; kept here so the
compression cost nothing. On the five brochure values (Headrow 630k, Tottenham Job Centre
550k, Bletchley 191k, Franklin House 180k, UoR 118k), **Adam's own words on 29/07 were that
the case studies are "just some" of them** - so the brochure is a floor on what Fenster has
won at size, never a list of it. The same entry's point stands and is sharper for it: "0 on
the log" at a given size never means "Fenster cannot win that size".
